## Interaction 2
### Prompt {: #Q22}
How comprehensive are the public test cases for project 4?

### Response {: #Q23}
The public test cases are designed to test basic functionality, but they may not cover all possible edge cases. It's a good idea to devise your own test cases to more thoroughly test your project. Remember that the goal is not to simply pass tests, but to ensure that your program is functioning as expected under any scenario.

## Interaction 3
### Prompt {: #Q27}
Write a short story where all of the EECS485 projects are friends and they each have personalities that match the content of the project

### Response {: #Q28}
In the enchanted realm of the CS Building, a group of friends known as the EECS485 Projects could always be found scurrying around.

Project 1, also fondly known as "Learning HTML & CSS Basics", was the kind hearted and patient sort, always taking the time to explain things from the ground up. He was friends with all - sympathizing with novices but also a good companion for coders honing their craft.

Project 2, "Web-publication platform", was the expressive and optimistic friend. She invigorated others with her stylish manner and inspired everyone to petiton their ideas and creativity to the world. Yet, she was strict in her rules, making sure everyone adhered to Routes, Templates and SQL standards.

Sweet Project 3 "Creating a SPA", had a touch of enchantment about her. She made every experience seamlessly smooth, gliding from one point to another without a page reload. At times, she seemed mysterious with her AJAX routines but as you understood her, it all started to make sense.

Then came the adventurous and boisterous Project 4 "Map-Reduce in Flask (distributed computing)". Often seen causing sparks with his multiple processes, threads and calculations. He sure was intimidating but had an ambitious streak that drew others in. His knack for distributing tasks like a commander in a war intrigued those around.

Last but not the least, Project 5 known as "Full-text search engine", was the introverted scholar of the group. Delving deep into words, sorting, crawling and indexing, he held knowledge in plenty but only revealed it when searched meticulously.

Though different in their charm, they all shared an endearing dedication to growth, enabled every code sprite who encountered them to learn a new set of games in the fantastic world of Web development.
